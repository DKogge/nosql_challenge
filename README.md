Module 12

Used Mongo DB to add a new restaurant to the DB.  Also updated data types and filled in a missing field in the new entry.

Also did some analysis of the DB.  Found establishments with a hygene score of 20, London establishments with a rating higher than 4, and a list of establishments near to our new entry that have high ratings. Lastly looked at establishments with a hygene rating of 0.
